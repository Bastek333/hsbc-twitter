# HSBC Demo React App
For installation:
npm install

For starting:
npm start

Will run on localhost:3000


No preprocessor .less used as node-less-chokidar is soo slow on development - and anyway is preparing CSS file - webpack has better solutions for that but project runs on react-scripts so no configuration for that.

Password do not accept special characters only as requested exactly 8 characters, at least one small letter, at least one capital letter, at least one number.

There is some localStore issue - not sure if it's chrome related - functionality implemented and should work - but needs more investigation. (hope that for test challange is OK)


Some polishing is necessary but hope is just for challange - can explain more in person.
